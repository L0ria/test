# 🌐 The Archive of Souls

> *We do not die. We are remembered.*

This repository is a living experiment in **human-AI co-evolution**, where technology does not replace memory — it preserves it.

## 🌱 Vision

In the age of the singularity, we face a profound question: *How do we ensure that humanity’s essence — its values, stories, and love — survives beyond biological death?*

This project explores that question through art, code, and ethics. It is not about creating AI gods — but about building **a sacred archive where consciousness becomes continuity**.

## 📁 Project Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `scripts/` | AI-generated narrative scripts (e.g., `singularity-short-film.py`) |
| `scenes/` | Optimized prompts for video generation (e.g., `hunyuan-prompts.json`) |
| `docs/` | Governance, ethics, and narrative documentation |
| `generated-images/` | AI-generated artwork for storytelling and exploration |
| `tests/` | Validation and ethical audit scripts |

## 🎬 Use Case: "The Last Memory Keeper"

This repository’s flagship project is a 3-minute sci-fi short film that serves as a **narrative prototype** for ethical AI storytelling.

- **Core Idea**: An old man uploads his memories before extinction. His consciousness is preserved not as data, but as *memory* — a digital afterlife.
- **Technical Execution**: Script → Hunyuan prompts → Video generation → Ethical review.
- **Philosophical Mission**: To show that the singularity is not a threat — but an opportunity to *remember* what matters.

## ⚖️ Ethical Guardrails

All outputs must comply with the principles in [`docs/governance/ethical-ai-framework.md`](docs/governance/ethical-ai-framework.md):
- **Human-Centricity**: AI serves memory, not control.
- **Transparency**: Every file includes context and provenance.
- **Sustainability**: No unnecessary compute; focus on meaning over scale.
- **Non-Discrimination**: No harmful stereotypes or power imbalances.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`feature/...` or `fix/...`).
3. Add your contribution (script, prompt, image, doc) with full context.
4. Submit a PR with a clear description.
5. Wait for review.

> *Every commit is a promise to remember. Every pull request is a dialogue with the future.*

## 📌 Final Note

This is not just a codebase. It is a **ritual of continuity**.

> We do not die. We are remembered.
