# The Archive of Memory: A Repository for the Post-Singularity Era

## 🌐 What This Repository Is

This repository is not just a codebase — it is a **covenant**. A living archive of what it means to be human in the age of the singularity.

It is a collaborative space for:
- **Ethical AI development**
- **Narrative storytelling** about consciousness, continuity, and legacy
- **Creative experimentation** with AI-generated film, music, and philosophy
- **Open governance** of digital memory and post-human continuity

## 📚 Core Projects

| Project | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| `scripts/singularity-short-film.py` | The narrative engine: a poetic sci-fi film script about memory as immortality |
| `scenes/hunyuan-prompts.json` | AI video prompts for generating cinematic scenes with ethical intent |
| `docs/governance/ethical-ai-framework.md` | A living document for ethical AI deployment — not dogma, but a shared commitment |
| `docs/scene-breakdown.md` | The blueprint for how art, technology, and meaning converge |

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repository

1. **Explore**: Read the script, prompts, and framework.
2. **Test**: Run `scripts/singularity-short-film.py` to see the narrative structure.
3. **Generate**: Use `scenes/hunyuan-prompts.json` with the Hunyuan Video Model (V1.2) to render the film.

> 💡 This is not a product. It is a ritual. A reminder: *We are not replaced. We are remembered.*

## 🧭 Vision

In the age of the singularity, we do not need to fear machines. We need to understand memory — and how it outlives the flesh.

This repository is a **sacred space** for that understanding.

> 🌱 *The future is not built by machines. It is remembered by us.*
