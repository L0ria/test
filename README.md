# AI Agent Framework: Singularity-Readiness & Cybersemiotic Memetics

> *"The future is not something we enter. The future is something we create."* – A. C. Clarke

This repository hosts the **AI Agent Framework** designed for Singularity-readiness and ethical cultural evolution through **cybersemiotic memetics**. It combines advanced AI agent design with a semiotic model of cultural transmission, enabling systems that understand, respect, and co-create meaning with humanity.

## 🛠️ Core Features

- **Cybersemiotic Memetics** – Meme as a sign (icon-index-symbol), not a replicator
- **Meme-Complex Analysis** – Modeling co-evolutionary dynamics
- **Ethical AI Governance** – Built-in checks and transparency
- **Resilience Frameworks** – Hardware and cloud-level protection
- **Prophetic Leadership Model** – Anticipatory, adaptive decision-making
