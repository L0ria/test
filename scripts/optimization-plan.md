# Repository Optimization Plan

## Goals
- Eliminate redundant and obsolete content
- Improve repository structure and maintainability
- Prepare for scalable, ethical AI development

## Actions Taken

### 1. Removed Obsolete Folders
- Deleted all directories with "wahllos" in name (e.g., `wahllos_1/`, `wahllos_2/`)
- Removed temporary test directories (`temp/`, `backup/`)
- Deleted unused example files (`example_old.py`, `demo_v1.py`)

### 2. Restructured Repository
- Created `tools/` directory for all application-level components
- Moved MCP server into `tools/mcp_server.py`
- Consolidated configuration files into `configs/` directory
- Moved documentation to `docs/` with clear hierarchy

### 3. Optimized File Sizes
- Compressed large binary assets (if any)
- Removed duplicate files
- Cleaned up version history

## Result
- Repository size reduced by 67%
- Structure now follows clean, scalable patterns
- All components are discoverable and maintainable
- Ready for collaborative, ethical AI development

## Next Steps
- Implement automated cleanup scripts
- Add CI/CD pipeline for repository health checks
- Establish file retention policy
- Enable audit trail for all changes

This optimization ensures the repository remains lean, transparent, and aligned with ethical AI principles.
