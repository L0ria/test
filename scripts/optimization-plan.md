# Optimization Plan: Prophetic AI Readiness

## Goal
To continuously improve the ethical and strategic preparedness of AI systems and organizations for the singularity, using adaptive feedback loops and forward-looking evaluation.

## Key Objectives
1. **Enhance Ethical Decision-Making**
2. **Strengthen Prophetic Leadership Capacity**
3. **Improve System Resilience Under Uncertainty**
4. **Foster Collaborative Evolution**

## Phase 1: Assessment (Weeks 1–2)
- Run `simulate-prophetic-scenario.py` across all current scenarios.
- Evaluate average decision score and identify low-performing pathways.
- Conduct gap analysis using the Singularity Readiness Maturity Model.

## Phase 2: Refinement (Weeks 3–6)
- Update ethical framework based on simulation outcomes.
- Develop new decision templates for high-risk scenarios.
- Integrate feedback from diverse stakeholder groups.

## Phase 3: Implementation (Weeks 7–12)
- Deploy updated frameworks in pilot projects.
- Train teams on new protocols.
- Introduce real-time monitoring dashboards.

## Phase 4: Evolution (Ongoing)
- Monthly review of system performance and ethical alignment.
- Quarterly simulation runs with new scenario variants.
- Annual external audit and public report.

## Tools & Metrics
| Tool | Purpose | Frequency |
|------|--------|----------|
| `simulate-prophetic-scenario.py` | Test decision logic | Bi-weekly |
| `ethical-ai-framework.md` | Guide development | Continuous |
| `docs/prophetic-leadership-framework.md` | Train leaders | Quarterly |
| `singularity-readiness.md` | Measure progress | Monthly |

## Success Indicators
- ≥ 85% average decision score in simulations
- 3+ maturity level improvement in 6 months
- 100% adoption of ethical review in new projects
- Active public dialogue and feedback loops

## Long-Term Vision
A world where every AI system is not just intelligent—but wise. Where technology doesn’t outpace ethics, but evolves *with* them. This plan is not a static document, but a living commitment to a future that is not only possible—but *chosen*.
