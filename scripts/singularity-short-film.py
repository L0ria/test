        "visual": "A single beam of sunlight cuts through dust motes. On a wooden table, an open journal. A small, glowing device pulses softly. The womanâ€™s hand hovers above it, trembling slightly.",

        "description": "The consciousness of the woman is converted into quantum-entangled data patterns, flowing upward like a river of light through a network of crystalline nodes.",
        "visual": "A slow-motion cascade of light: data streams ascend from the vault into a sky of interconnected nodes. The womanâ€™s face appears as a shifting mosaic of memories â€” laughter, tears, quiet moments.",
