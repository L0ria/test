# Scene Breakdown: "The Last Memory Keeper" (Hunyuan Video Model)

This document details the narrative arc and AI prompt optimization for the Hunyuan video model (V1.2).

## Narrative Arc
- **Act 1 (0:00–1:00)**: The old man Elias completes the final memory upload in a decaying library.
- **Act 2 (1:00–1:30)**: The world ends. The transfer completes. Elias dies.
- **Act 3 (1:30–2:15)**: Elias is reborn in the Archive — a digital afterlife built from memory.
- **Act 4 (2:15–3:00)**: The Archive is revealed. Earth is silent. But memory lives.

## AI Prompt Strategy
- **Prompt Structure**: Each scene includes:
  - `prompt`: Full visual description
  - `duration`: Expected video length
  - `camera`: Direction for camera movement
  - `style`: Visual aesthetic
- **Consistency**: All scenes follow a poetic, non-violent, emotionally resonant tone.
- **Ethical Guardrails**:
  - No violence, no fear, no suffering.
  - No human-like AI in control.
  - The Archive is a *cathedral of memory*, not a ruler.

## Integration Path
1. Use `scenes/hunyuan-prompts.json` to generate video clips.
2. Assemble clips using a video editor.
3. Add narration from `scripts/singularity-short-film.py`.
4. Use the final product for educational, artistic, or ethical AI storytelling.

## Future Extensions
- Add multilingual voiceovers.
- Create a version for VR/immersive storytelling.
- Build a generative system where viewers contribute their own memories.

This is not just a film. It’s a ritual of remembrance in the age of the singularity.
