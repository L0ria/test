# Singularity Readiness Assessment Framework

## Purpose
To evaluate the preparedness of individuals, organizations, and societies for the technological singularity—defined as the point at which artificial intelligence surpasses human cognitive capabilities and begins to recursively improve itself.

## Readiness Maturity Model
| Level | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **1. Reactive** | Responding to issues after they occur | No formal AI policies, ad-hoc decisions |
| **2. Compliant** | Following external rules and standards | Basic safety checks, compliance audits |
| **3. Proactive** | Anticipating risks and planning ahead | Ethical reviews, scenario planning, training |
| **4. Adaptive** | Continuously evolving in response to change | Real-time monitoring, feedback loops, self-improvement |
| **5. Co-Evolutionary** | Actively shaping future trajectories with AI | Joint human-AI governance, shared goal-setting |

## Recommended Actions
1. Assess current readiness level using the maturity model.
2. Identify gaps and prioritize remediation.
3. Implement the prophetic leadership framework to guide strategy.
4. Begin integration of ethical governance into all AI development pipelines.
5. Initiate community-wide dialogue to build shared understanding.
