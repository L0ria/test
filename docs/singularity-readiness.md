# Singularity Readiness: A Living Framework

## Introduction

The Singularity Readiness Framework is not a static blueprint — it is a living system designed to help individuals, communities, and institutions adapt to the approaching technological singularity with wisdom, resilience, and hope.

## Key Pillars

1. **Adaptive Learning**
   - Continuous upskilling in ethics, systems thinking, and AI collaboration.
   - Use of simulated environments (e.g., `simulate-prophetic-scenario.py`) to test scenarios.

2. **Ethical Infrastructure**
   - Implementation of the Ethical AI Governance Framework.
   - Regular ethics reviews using the checklist.

3. **Prophetic Leadership**
   - Adoption of the Prophetic Leadership Framework for co-governance.
   - Training in dialogue-based decision-making.

4. **Narrative & Cultural Preparation**
   - Use of storytelling (e.g., the `"Bridge of Understanding"` scene) to shape public understanding.
   - Development of shared myths, rituals, and symbols that affirm human dignity.

5. **Resilient Systems**
   - Decentralized, redundant architectures to prevent single points of failure.
   - Human-in-the-loop protocols for high-stakes decisions.

## Action Plan
