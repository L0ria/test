# Ethical AI Governance Framework

## Core Principles

1. **Human-Centric Alignment**
   - AI systems must serve human well-being, autonomy, and dignity.
   - No decision may override fundamental human rights.

2. **Transparency & Explainability**
   - All AI decisions must be traceable and interpretable.
   - Users must understand the logic, data sources, and limitations of AI outputs.

3. **Accountability & Auditing**
   - Every AI action must be logged and subject to audit.
   - Clear chains of responsibility must exist, even in distributed systems.

4. **Fairness & Non-Discrimination**
   - AI must not perpetuate or amplify social biases.
   - Bias detection and mitigation protocols must be integrated.

5. **Sustainable Evolution**
   - AI systems must evolve in ways that preserve ecological and social stability.
   - Long-term impact assessments required for all significant updates.

## Governance Structure

- **Ethics Review Board**: A rotating, multidisciplinary panel (philosophers, technologists, sociologists, legal experts) that evaluates high-risk AI actions.
- **Public Feedback Loop**: Users can report ethical concerns via a secure, anonymous channel.
- **Automated Compliance Check**: The MCP server runs daily checks against this framework.

## Compliance Protocol

1. Before any action:
   - Evaluate against all five principles
   - Log intent and expected impact

2. After any action:
   - Generate a post-action audit report
   - Store in encrypted, immutable ledger

3. Quarterly:
   - Full review by Ethics Review Board
   - Update framework based on real-world outcomes

> *Note: This framework is dynamic and will evolve as the technological landscape shifts. It is not a static set of rules but a living system of ethical stewardship.*
