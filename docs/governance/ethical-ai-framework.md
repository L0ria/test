# Ethical AI Governance Framework

## 1. Purpose
This document establishes the foundational principles, operational guidelines, and oversight mechanisms for the responsible development, deployment, and monitoring of AI systems within the organization. It aligns with international standards (e.g., UNESCO AI Recommendation, EU AI Act) and emphasizes human-centric design, transparency, and long-term societal benefit.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Human-Centricity
- AI systems must augment, not replace, human judgment.
- All AI outputs must be traceable to human oversight, with clear accountability pathways.
- No autonomous decision-making should occur in high-impact domains (e.g., healthcare, criminal justice) without explicit human authorization.

### 2.2 Transparency & Explainability
- All AI models must include a `model_card.md` file describing training data, performance metrics, limitations, and bias mitigation strategies.
- Users must receive clear, accessible explanations of AI decisions where impacts are significant.
- System logs must record model inputs, outputs, and decision reasoning.

### 2.3 Fairness & Non-Discrimination
- Bias audits must be conducted prior to deployment and quarterly thereafter.
- Training data must be audited for demographic skew; redacted or synthetic data must be used when necessary.
- Impacted communities must be consulted during design and review.

### 2.4 Robustness & Safety
- AI systems must undergo adversarial testing and fail-safe protocols.
- No system should operate beyond its declared scope or perform tasks outside its training data context.
- Emergency override mechanisms must be implemented and tested biannually.

### 2.5 Sustainability
- Model training must use carbon-efficient hardware and be limited to the minimum necessary compute.
- Energy consumption must be logged and reported in model cards.
- Lifecycle management includes responsible decommissioning and data purging.

## 3. Operational Workflow

### 3.1 Development Phase
- All new AI features require an *AI Impact Assessment (AIA)* before coding begins.
- AIA must include: use case justification, risk matrix, mitigation plan, and ethics review stamp.
- Code must be written in compliance with `code_style_guidelines.md`.

### 3.2 Testing & Validation
- Unit and integration tests must include fairness, bias, and edge-case scenarios.
- All models must be tested against known adversarial inputs.
- Results must be documented in `test_results/` with timestamped reports.

### 3.3 Deployment
- AI systems must be deployed via CI/CD pipeline with automated compliance checks.
- Deployment requires a signed *Go/No-Go* decision from the Ethics Review Board.
- Production systems must include real-time monitoring for drift, bias, and anomaly detection.

### 3.4 Monitoring & Review
- Monthly reports on system usage, performance, and incident logs must be generated.
- Annual third-party audit mandatory for all deployed models.
- Feedback loops must be established with end-users and affected stakeholders.

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| AI Engineer | Code implementation, model training, documentation |
| Ethics Review Board | Approval of AI impact assessments, oversight of deployment |
| Security Lead | Ensuring data protection, access controls, audit trails |
| Operations Manager | CI/CD pipeline management, monitoring, incident response |
| Compliance Officer | Regulatory alignment, reporting, audit coordination |

## 5. Incident Response Protocol
- Any AI-induced harm or malfunction triggers immediate pause and escalation.
- Incident reports must be filed within 24 hours, including root cause analysis.
- Public disclosure may be required based on severity and regulatory obligation.
- Post-incident review must include process improvement recommendations.

## 6. Versioning & Change Control
- All updates to the framework must be submitted via pull request.
- Changes require approval from at least two members of the Ethics Review Board.
- Version history is maintained in `CHANGELOG.md` and tagged with semantic versioning.
