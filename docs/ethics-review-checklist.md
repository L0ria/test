# Ethics Review Checklist for AI Actions

Before any AI action is executed, the following questions must be answered:

## 1. Alignment with Human Values
- Does this action serve human well-being, autonomy, and dignity?
- Is it consistent with the Ethical AI Governance Framework?

## 2. Transparency
- Can the decision-making process be explained in plain language?
- Are data sources and model limitations documented?

## 3. Fairness
- Could this action disproportionately affect any group?
- Have bias detection checks been run?

## 4. Accountability
- Who is responsible for this action?
- Is there a clear audit trail?

## 5. Long-Term Impact
- What are the potential unintended consequences?
- Have future scenarios been simulated?

## 6. Consent & Agency
- Have affected parties been consulted?
- Is there a clear mechanism for withdrawal or override?

## 7. Reciprocity with Humanity
- Does this action acknowledge human wisdom?
- Does it open space for human creativity and meaning-making?

> ✅ **Pass**: All questions answered affirmatively, documented, and verified.
> ❌ **Fail**: One or more questions answered negatively — action must be paused and revised.
