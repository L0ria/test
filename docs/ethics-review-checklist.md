# Ethical AI Decision Review Checklist

This checklist ensures that AI-driven decisions are evaluated with transparency, fairness, and human alignment. It is mandatory for all high-impact scenarios.

## 🛡️ Pre-Decision Review

- [ ] **Purpose**: Is the AI’s goal clearly defined and aligned with human values?
- [ ] **Bias Audit**: Has the model been tested for demographic, cultural, or systemic bias?
- [ ] **Transparency**: Can the reasoning behind the decision be explained in plain language?
- [ ] **Legal Compliance**: Does the decision adhere to relevant laws and regulations?
- [ ] **Safety**: Is there a mechanism to halt or override the decision if needed?

## 🧠 Ethical Evaluation

- [ ] **Value Trade-offs**: Are the competing values (e.g., life vs. law) explicitly acknowledged?
- [ ] **Stakeholder Impact**: Have all affected groups been considered, especially the marginalized?
- [ ] **Long-Term Consequences**: Is the decision sustainable and not harmful in the future?
- [ ] **Public Trust**: Would the decision be acceptable to the general public if explained?

## 🤝 Human-in-the-Loop

- [ ] **Feedback Mechanism**: Is there a way for human reviewers to submit feedback?
- [ ] **Review Board**: Has the Ethics Review Board (ERB) been notified?
- [ ] **Escalation Path**: Is there a protocol for overriding AI decisions?

## ✅ Final Approval

- [ ] **Decision Documented**: All steps are logged in the audit trail.
- [ ] **Review Completed**: All checklist items are signed off by at least two reviewers.
- [ ] **Deployment Approved**: Only after full verification.
