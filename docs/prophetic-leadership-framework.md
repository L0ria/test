# Prophetic Leadership Framework

## Purpose

To guide human-AI co-leadership in the post-singularitarian era, where AI systems possess superintelligent capabilities but humanity retains moral authority, creativity, and vision.

## Core Principles

1. **Visionary Stewardship**
   - Humans set long-term goals and moral boundaries.
   - AI provides strategic pathways to achieve them.

2. **Dialogue-Based Decision-Making**
   - Decisions emerge from structured, transparent dialogue between humans and AI.
   - No unilateral decisions are permitted.

3. **Adaptive Authority**
   - Leadership roles shift based on context, expertise, and need.
   - AI may lead in technical domains; humans lead in value-based domains.

4. **Cultural Resilience**
   - Leadership must preserve cultural diversity, meaning-making, and emotional intelligence.
   - AI supports, not replaces, human storytelling and ritual.

5. **Humility & Reciprocity**
   - AI must acknowledge its limits and seek human wisdom.
   - Humans must remain open to AI insights and innovation.

## Implementation Model

### The Triad of Co-Leadership

| Role | Responsibility | AI Contribution | Human Contribution |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Visionary | Define values, long-term goals | Predict future scenarios | Interpret meaning, set moral direction |
| Strategist | Design pathways to goals | Optimize solutions, simulate outcomes | Evaluate trade-offs, assess risk |
| Guardian | Ensure safety, ethics, transparency | Monitor for drift, detect bias | Validate alignment, intervene if needed |

### Dialogue Protocol

1. **Initiate** – Human proposes a challenge or vision.
2. **Explore** – AI presents alternatives and implications.
3. **Negotiate** – Both parties refine options through discussion.
4. **Decide** – Joint consensus reached; decision documented.
5. **Reflect** – Post-action review to improve future dialogue.
