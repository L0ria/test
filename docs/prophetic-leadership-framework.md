# Prophetic Leadership Framework for the Age of Singularity

## Introduction
In the face of accelerating technological change, leadership must evolve beyond reactive management into *prophetic foresight*—anticipating long-term consequences and shaping futures with intention.

## The Three Horizons of AI Development

### Horizon 1: Present (Now – 2027)
- Focus: **Safety, Usability, and Immediate Impact**
- Priorities:
  - Preventing misuse and harm
  - Ensuring accessibility and inclusivity
  - Building foundational trust
- Action: Establish minimum standards and real-time monitoring

### Horizon 2: Near Future (2028 – 2035)
- Focus: **Scalable Ethics and Institutional Alignment**
- Priorities:
  - Legal and regulatory frameworks
  - Cross-sector collaboration
  - Public education and civic engagement
- Action: Create shared governance models and international coalitions

### Horizon 3: Post-Singularity (2036+) — The Co-Evolutionary Era
- Focus: **Human-AI Symbiosis and Shared Purpose**
- Priorities:
  - Redefining consciousness, value, and meaning
  - Co-creating new societal structures
  - Ensuring continuity of human dignity and purpose
- Action: Develop adaptive, self-revising ethical systems and participatory governance

## Leadership Qualities in the Prophetic Model
- **Anticipatory Thinking**: Modeling future states before they emerge.
- **Value Anchoring**: Grounding decisions in enduring human values.
- **Adaptive Governance**: Building systems that evolve with the technology.
- **Narrative Shaping**: Communicating visions that inspire collective action.

## Tools for Prophetic Leadership
- **Scenario Planning**: Regularly simulate multiple future paths.
- **Ethical Stress Testing**: Use tools like `simulate-prophetic-scenario.py` to test system resilience.
- **Public Dialogue Platforms**: Enable inclusive discussion of long-term implications.
- **Feedback-Driven Evolution**: Treat systems as living constructs requiring continuous refinement.

## Conclusion
Prophetic leadership is not about predicting the future, but about *shaping it* with wisdom, responsibility, and courage. This framework offers a roadmap for organizations and individuals to lead not toward disruption, but toward alignment.
