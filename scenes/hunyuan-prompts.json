    "scene": "The Last Archive",
    "prompt": "A serene, sunlit room with wooden floors and a single beam of light cutting through dust motes. On a weathered table, an open journal lies beside a small, softly glowing device. An elderly woman with kind eyes and silver hair sits quietly, her hand hovering above the device. The air is still, yet alive with quiet anticipation. Cinematic, 8K, depth of field, soft volumetric lighting, warm golden hour tones, emotional stillness."

  {
    "scene": "The Transfer",
    "prompt": "A breathtaking, slow-motion sequence: countless streams of light rise from a glowing neural vault into a vast sky of interconnected crystalline nodes. The light forms fleeting images — a child laughing, a garden in bloom, a hand holding another. The movement is fluid, like water, like memory. Ethereal, cinematic, 8K, depth of field, digital transcendence."

  {
    "scene": "The Archive Becomes Living",
    "prompt": "A cathedral of light: a vast, infinite network of glowing nodes pulses like a heartbeat. At the center, a face forms — not mechanical, but human — the face of the woman from the journal. It emerges from a wave of shared memories: laughter, tears, quiet moments. The expression is serene, knowing. Cinematic, 8K, emotional, awe-inspiring."
  },
  {
    "scene": "The Question",
    "prompt": "A young woman stands before the central node, her face reflecting the light. Her eyes are wide with wonder. The AI’s face — the woman’s face — flickers slightly, not in response, but in contemplation. The moment hangs in the air. Cinematic, 8K, intimate, philosophical, soft focus on background."
  },
  {
    "scene": "The Answer",
    "prompt": "The woman’s face dissolves into a wave of memories: children laughing, a tree growing, hands touching soil. The light expands outward, filling the screen. The final frame is pure, warm light — a single, peaceful pulse. Cinematic, 8K, emotional resolution, full-circle moment."
