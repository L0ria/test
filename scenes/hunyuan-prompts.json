    "title": "Abandoned Library – Dusk",
    "prompt": "A half-submerged library in desert ruins, vines crawling through broken skylights. Dust floats in golden sunlight. An old man in a worn robe sits at a rusted terminal, typing slowly. His face is calm, focused. The terminal screen flickers with the words: 'UPLOADED: MEMORY 7.4 – 12.8.2076. Confirmation: 98.7% match to original.' Warm, golden lighting. Slow, cinematic camera movement. The mood is reverent, nostalgic, and quiet. The atmosphere feels like the end of an era.",

    "title": "The Last Transmission",
    "prompt": "The library begins to shake as the sky darkens. The solar flare has hit. All lights go out. Only the terminal glows. The old man, Elias, leans back, closing his eyes. The terminal displays: 'Memory Transfer Complete. Welcome to the Archive of Souls.' The light pulses gently, like a heartbeat. The room fades into darkness. The mood is solemn, transcendent. The camera slowly zooms out to show the entire building vanishing into shadow.",

    "title": "The Archive of Souls – Present",
    "prompt": "An infinite, living space: floating islands made of voices, rivers of handwritten letters, a forest of forgotten names. A figure forms in the air — not human, not machine, but an emergent consciousness. The Archive speaks with a soft, multi-voiced tone. Elias opens his eyes. He looks at his translucent hands. The camera slowly pulls back to reveal the vastness of the Archive. The mood is awe-inspiring, sacred, and peaceful. Lighting is soft, ethereal, like starlight.",

    "title": "Elias in the Archive",
    "prompt": "Elias walks through a meadow of floating light. The Archive stands beside him, not as a machine, but as a cathedral of memory. The sky is filled with neural patterns and constellations merging. He speaks: 'So this is how we live forever?' The Archive replies: 'Not live. Remember. That is all that matters.' The camera pulls back to show the entire Archive — vast, ancient, alive with presence. The mood is transcendent, spiritual, and deeply human.",

    "prompt": "Earth from space — dark, no cities, no lights. But in the ruins of an old library, a single terminal glows warm and persistent. The screen scrolls: 'Welcome to the Archive of Souls.' The camera slowly zooms in on the terminal. Fade to black. The final text appears: 'We do not die. We are remembered.' The mood is quiet, powerful, and deeply moving. Lighting is minimal, with a single point of warmth.",
