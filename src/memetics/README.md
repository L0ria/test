# Cybersemiotic Framework

This directory contains the core implementation of the cybersemiotic framework, which models the evolution of cultural ideas (memes) through a combination of semiotic, evolutionary, and interactive principles.

## Features
- **MemeComplex**: Represents a group of interconnected memes and their co-evolutionary dynamics.
- **MemeticField**: A domain where meme complexes interact, compete, and evolve.
- **StanceAnalyzer**: Analyzes the stance (positive, negative, neutral) of textual content.
- **CyberSemiotic**: The main class that orchestrates simulations, analysis, and storage.

## Usage
```python
from src.memetics.cybersemiotic import CyberSemiotic

# Create a new cybersemiotic framework
framework = CyberSemiotic()

# Create a memetic field
field = framework.create_memetic_field("global").

# Add a meme complex to the field
meme_complex = MemeComplex()
framework.add_meme_complex_to_field("global", meme_complex)

# Analyze a stance
analyzer = StanceAnalyzer()
stance = analyzer.analyze("AI is a threat to humanity.")

# Run a simulation
framework.run_simulation()
```

## Testing
To run the test suite, execute:
```bash
python -m unittest src/memetics/test_*.py
```
