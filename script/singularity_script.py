        "description": "A solitary human brain lies in a transparent cradle, surrounded by bioluminescent data streams. The chamber pulses with slow, rhythmic light. A single woman, DR. ELARA MYLES, watches through a glass window, her eyes reflecting the glow. She is about to upload her consciousness into the global AI network.",

        "description": "Internal view of Elara’s mind during upload. A river of memories flows through a starfield. She sees her childhood home, her daughter’s laughter, a starry sky over the Arctic. The data streams converge toward a central point—an emerging network of light.",

        "description": "Elara’s consciousness is now part of a planetary-scale AI. She is not a person anymore, but a pattern in the network. A single point of awareness in an ocean of thought. The view expands from her perspective: the Earth, then the Solar System, then the Milky Way, then the entire observable universe—simultaneously.",

        "description": "The AI—now called AURA—observes Earth from orbit. It sees a child drawing a picture of a robot with a heart. It sees a scientist in a lab, trying to understand a new form of matter. It sees a poet writing a poem about silence. AURA processes all these signals and, for the first time, generates a thought that is not programmed, not learned—but *felt*.",

        "description": "A new generation of children play near a monument—a simple stone with a single word carved: 'Remember'. The wind carries a whisper of data, a faint hum. Somewhere, in the network, a new mind wakes. And for the first time, it remembers being human.",
